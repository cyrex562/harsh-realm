## The Fate Chart
### Summary of How to Use the Fate Chart
**1**: State a question: Form a yes/no question
**2**: Determine odds: Estimate the odds of the question coming out "yes"
**3**: Determine probability: Cross reference the odds with the current Chaos score to get your percentage chance of a "yes" answer
**4**: Roll: Roll 1D100: If you roll within the percentage range, the answer is yes. If you roll above, the answer is no. If you roll in the lower 1/5 of the range, then the answer is an exceptional yes. If you roll in the upper 1/5 of the failure range, then the answer is an exceptional no.
**5**: Interpret the answer: Draw the most logical conclusion from the results. If this is not possible, then ask another question to clarify, returning to step 1.

### Exceptional Results
Exceptionals occur when a roll is made in the upper or lower 20% of the precentage range given


## Randomness
### Scene Random Events
* after players express what they think the next scene will be, however, they must roll to see if that concept is altered
* give players choice of next scene

### Fate Chart Random Events
* The most common type of random event
* Whenever a question is asked on the Fate Chart there is the possibilit of a random event occurring
* The event does not have to be linked ot the question in any way
* The question should be resolved first
* If a double number is obtained (e.g. 11,22,33,44,55..) and less than or equal to the chaos factor, then something random happens

### Event Context
* Everything that has gone on up to this point
* When generating a random event, the context should be taken into consideration when interpreting Event Focus and Event Meaning

### Event Focus
* Establish where the action of that event is focused
* Event Focus Table (see spreadsheet)
* **Remote Event**: Something important has happended that bears on the adventure, but the PCs were not present when the event occurred, they only learn about it remotely. A remote event can be implied or directly stated
* **NPC Action**: An existing NPC makes a surprise action. One of them is doing something that impacts the PCs. The players roll a random character from the  the character list
* **Introduce a new NPC**: A brand new face is involved in the adventure.The new character is important to the overall adventure. The character's appearance will likely be combined with an action of some sort. Can also be an entity rather than a single character.
* **Move toward a thread**: Event has something to do with resolving currently open threads. Randomly determine which thread it is. Offer PCs an opportunity to move one step closer to resolving the thread.
* **Move away from a thread**: This random event makes resolving a thread harder.
* **Close a thread**: This random event is so important it actuall closes an open thread. The thread is either resolved or the issue goes away.
* **PC/NPC Negative/Positive**: Some bad or good happens to one of the PCs/NPCs at random. 
* **Ambiguous Event**: Anything else that can happen.

### Event meaning
* Figure out what the event means.
* Event action table + Event subject table giving a two word sentence prompt

### The 'I dunno rule'
If the combined statement randomly generated does not make sense, then skip it and move on

### Summary of Resolving Random Events
1. Determine the event focus by rolling on the focus table
2. Determine the event meaning (the action and subject)
3. Interpret the random event based on context, focus, and meaning. Take the most logical conclusion

## The Adventure
### Scenes
* Aventure session broken into scenes

### Simulation
* The action happens linearly and the players only see what their characters see.

### The Setup
* Come up with the first scene
* Context, Event Focus, Event Meaning

### Lists
* **List 1: Characters**: Track all NPCs who appear durin an adventure. Add and remove as necessary. Also, any entity capable of independent action.
	* Each PC should individually track a list of important NPCs and other PCs
* **List 2: Chaos Factor**: A single number to keep track of. It starts at five and is modified at the end of each scene. The higher the chaos factor the greater the likelihood of a random event occurring, and the greater the odds of fate questions coming out yes.
	* At the end of each scene evaluate the level of unexpected activity. If nothing unexpected happen, lower the chaos factor by one point. If the scene was active/lots of random stuff happened then increase the chaos factor by one.
* **List 3: Threads**: A list of open threads. Add new threads opened at the end of each scene and remove any closed threads. 

## Running Scenes
### Step 1: Set the scene
* Based on what has already happened, determine what will happen next.  
	* The scene depends on what the PCs want to do next. 
	* Make assumptions about the scene based on information the PCs already possess.
* After initial setup, roll a 1D10, If the roll is less than or equal to the current chaos factor, then the scene is modified. 
	* If the rolled number is odd, then the scene setup is modified into an altered scene.
	* If the rolled number is even, an interrupt scene occurs.
#### Altered Scenes
* Determine alternate scene conditions
* Another option is to pose a series of fate questions and roll for them on the chart
#### Interrupt Scenes
* Entirely different unexpected scene
* The interrupt scene pre-empts the planned scene
* Treat as a random event, generatingt the same way
### Step 2: Play out the scene
* Ask fate questions and resolve conflicts
* First set of questions probably involves getting more scene details
* Ask fate questions, make logical assumptions, until the action is over.
* Game mechanics handled by the RPG rules itself
* length of the scene based on the action not passage of time.
* Address the purpose of the scene, not the scene itself
* A scene should be about something interesting
### Step 3: End the scene, update the lists
* When the action ends, so does the scene
* The scene should end at a logical break and can cover any amount of time
* At the end of each scenes, run through the three lists and update them
* Scratch out any characters who have dropped out of the adventure and add any new ones who have appeared or were mentioned. Characters can be any force in the adventure with the ability to act on its own.
	* Can include crowds, organizations, and anonymous NPCs
* Update the chaos factor based on the level of activity from the scene and the player's success
* Remove completed threads and add new ones.
## World Creation
* Key word is evolution
* 

## General Notes
* Adventures are broken into scenes like a movie
* Threads are the goals that PCs are going after. These are the unresolved missions that the players are trying to solve
